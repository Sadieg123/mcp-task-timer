# mcp-task-timer

## Overview
This is a **Complete Tier MCP server** that provides two tools — `start_timer` and `stop_timer` — to track the time spent on named tasks.  
It is built in **TypeScript** using the official **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** and communicates via **stdio** with Claude Code.  

The server allows you to:

- Start a timer for a specific task
- Stop the timer and see elapsed time
- Handle errors like starting an existing timer or stopping a timer that doesn’t exist
